# Notarize + staple a DMG built by build-dmg.sh. No-ops (with a warning,
# not a failure) if no notarization credentials are set, so unsigned local/
# dev builds keep working unchanged.
#
# Credentials, checked in this order:
#   1. APPLE_API_KEY_ID / APPLE_API_ISSUER / APPLE_API_KEY_P8 — an App Store
#      Connect API key (APPLE_API_KEY_P8 is the base64 contents of the
#      downloaded .p8 file). What CI uses.
#   2. NOTARY_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE — a profile saved locally via:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials <profile> \
#          --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID \
#          --password APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD   # from appleid.apple.com
#   3. APPLE_ID / APPLE_TEAM_ID / APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD directly.
#
# See the "Signing & notarization" section in the README for setup.
